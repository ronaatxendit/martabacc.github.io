<p>Never thougt Iâ€™ll ended up being engineery and all its stuff, but I really love what I do now. It suits me so much so it never comes to me that Iâ€™m actually working the entire day.</p>

<p>Also I have a keen interest on strength training, particular on weightlifting. You may see some of my writings here regarding those topics. Since itâ€™s been only a year, Iâ€™m still a greenie in the field, but Iâ€™m eager to learn about it. <em>Yea, itâ€™s that addicting</em>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d like to describe my strength ability, in general, as <em>lack of natural ability but tries hard.</em></p>

<h3 id="why-airavata--bakpia-from-baccpia">Why Airavata &amp; Bakpia (from <em>baccpia</em>)</h3>
<p>I had a good Hinduese friend, and he likes to explain their philosophy and telling me stories about Hinduese goddess. I liked the stories and then I read more about their creatures, and I came up to this: Airavata.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Airavata (Sanskrit: à¤à¤°à¤¾à¤µà¤¤ â€œbelonging to Iravatiâ€) is a white elephant who carries the Hindu god Indra. It is also called â€˜abhra-Matangaâ€™, meaning â€œelephant of the cloudsâ€; â€˜Naga-mallaâ€™, meaning â€œthe fighting elephantâ€; and â€˜Arkasodaraâ€™, meaning â€œbrother of the sunâ€.</p>

  <p>Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Airavata is Indraâ€™s elephant. Airavata has four tusks and seven trunks and is spotless white. It is also known as Erawan in Thai. Airavata is also the third son of Kashyap and Kadru. In the Mahabharata he is listed as a great serpent.</p>

<p>Airavata has lists of excellent traits, and I wish I can be as good as it.</p>

<p>Baccpia,  well itâ€™s obvious, no? Itâ€™s my favorite snackies. I once ate it for straight three days, no other meal, just because I like them so much.</p>
