I'm resigning in next three weeks. Will be having two spare weeks before jumping on my next hitchike.

I never thought make a new beginning is hard. I now enjoy the scenery from 18th-floor window much more than I ever did. Maybe because my new office don't have the same window.

I always thinking of having a new start. But now it's actually in front of my eyes, I feel my ground is a bit shaky. But don't get me wrong, I'm solid on my vision and what I'm gonna do next, this should be a little turbulence.

I'm certain, after doing some calculations and considering my risk appetite for a job, this is a good option for me. I'm just wondering what I don't know, that hasn't been taken into account.

You know what? Someone told me that wrong decision is never such thing. It was the best decision, at the time it was made, with the information acknowledged at that time. I think some principal engineer in Gojek told me that, in a tech talks.

That is very true, indeed.

So, I'm taking a big breath. Having some sadness and hollowness as now I'm leaving a company that has been part of me for years, has shaped me, taught and guided me. Jenius is really a good company for growth and learning, I guarantee for tech peeps you should take a look there and see what they did. People at Jenius are awesome.

I never know what I'll find in my  new company. I hope it could be next best thing that happens to me. Hoping for the best!
