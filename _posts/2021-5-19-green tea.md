Three years ago, there was an ice cream roll store at a mall, near from my office. Every day I always stopped there to buy a nice green tea ice cream.

Despite its price (almost $2 for a cup), I find it suits the price because of the taste. I love it so much - that I even thought of opening my own ice cream roll store, but later I decided not to due to its specific tech that is a bit pricy.

I often found myself queueing along with kids, or their parents. That was funny but I'm still waiting for my turn. My sweet baby matcha ice cream, my forever delight.

Sadly, it closes 3 months after. I noticed that their employees regularly decreasing each month - first there are 4 employees attending the store and at the last month I saw them there was only one, handling both cashier and making ice cream.

I can read the situation that it could be signs - my favorite ice cream store is about to be bankrupt.

My heart so broke when I came again a week after and found no one there. Lights were off. I was like super excited for my delight and instead what I see is sadness.

I never been so heartbroken. I even tried to locate another store - maybe it's open, right? But nope - the entire icecream roll is closed, once and for all.

Now, every time I walks by the store it used to be - I can taste their ice cream in my mouth. Soft, creamy and tasty. One day I hope I can taste them again, I hope it's in this current lifetime ;)
