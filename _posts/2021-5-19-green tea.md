I think know chess at age of 7 ? but it took around 17 years later for me to find enjoyment in it.

I hate checkmates. But I enjoy delivering one (haha such double standard).

But despite it is interesting and I enjoy it so much, it is a tough sport and require tedious practices and knowledges. Little did I know, memorizing certain positions and what happens next is common things in chess.

What I love about it is - playing chess is like painting. It requires creativity of what color -  what moves we pick next, and we can pick any moves we want. But why should we? Then you check what your opponent will do, what will they do? And why should they do that?

That particular process is called calculating. Yes, calculating in math is already difficult, and then comes calculating moves in chess.

It kinda like drawing a graph, with certain node is scored by our winning-likely measurement.

Due to my very short attention-span, I can only last one depth of calculation in my every move of chess. Pity of me, this ease my opponents to deliver mate sooner before my eyes (LOL).

But no worry, even grandmasters said that calculation requires years of practicing and studying. It didn't happen in one night.

But also what is interesting about this is, there are people out there making their own life by playing chess. Never occurs to me to play chess to make a living, but apparently if you play well you can earn money like regular athletes.

(well, is chess even a sport? Hahaha)

It's hard. Currently only remembers three openings/attacks and around two defenses, and still blunders my pieces (HAHAHAHA). I got very disappointed when mated but I also persists in keep playing chess.

I don't know why chess is so attractive - despite I loses all the time, I still like to learn and study how to win.

Sometimes a thought comes to my mind - stop these ridiculous games you better exercise on what you do best - coding. Chess is like learning mandarin,and I am a beginner, in which if I was learning in formal institution, I will have kindergarten students as my classmate. Such a pity.

I know that I'm a noob, but somehow I still decide to play it anyways, and think of it all the time. Kid you not, lately I've dreamed about several positions in chess. It just stuck in my mind and I don't know why.
