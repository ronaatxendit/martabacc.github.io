my mom lectured vocational students for years until she retired. and dad was a lecturer (before he decided to out since he need more time focusing on his postgraduate study) at a small university in my hometown.

well, apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I enjoy teaching too.

I aspired to be one of compsci lecturer, but regulation here states that at least someone must finish post graduate degree to be qualified.

and I still cannot find where should I fit postgraduate into my life timeline - is it two years? three years?
