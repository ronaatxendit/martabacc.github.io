title: "opportunity cost & their prices"
--- 

it is often that the least person we know best is ourselves. sometimes I was drawn into thoughts of something in the past, the thoughts and the conclusion I took afterwards. and I got confused, like, that was one hell of a rollercoaster.

but if I can turn the clock back, I'll do it again.

one thing I never saw coming in my adult age - is the realization that my dad is such a safe-player. he rarely took risks - and he kinda despise people who does. I still respect him though, but he is usually not the first person I go to when I seek for advice.

not because he didn't say what I wanted to hear, but his advice is predictable. like newbies playing chess - mate in three moves (hahaha) (on side note, ily so much dad xoxo). we just don't share same preferences in life.

I may not know myself very much, but safe-player is never in me. I take risks, and as time goes, those risks become more calculated and precisely, carefully taken.

i'm here for advances. tomorrow must be better than today, and today must be better than yesterday. some mistakes were made - but that is not an exception to stop.
