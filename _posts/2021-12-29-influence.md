title: "influence"
--- 

One of honour I'd like to earn - is mentoring engineers into the best outcome they can be. I want to have a team that's proud for having me, having progress together and learns together.

It's amazing of how you can know someone just several minutes of talking. Even just from chat, their interactions, reflect their interests.

What I never saw coming was, them growing with me is not the only outcomes. I also happened to share my aspirations - unknowingly.

Perhaps that's how influence works. People pick up not only what you share, but also what you do it for. They pick up your energy, your perspectives, your values.

Perhaps that's why my previous company's CTO left along with around 3 levels above him, following the path of the CEO who decided to build his dream somewhere else. People tend to follow a leader they trust in, that they share values with.

The dynamic of human interaction, huh?

PS: What I love from my current office right now is, how often they conduct 1 on 1 with their engineers and superiors. We are in a small org right now, and it's important to share same value since we have not much momentum (compared to corporate ones).

It's make it easier to touch non-technical aspect of engineers, to strengthen relationship and build trust. Something I never know was important in my previous experience.
