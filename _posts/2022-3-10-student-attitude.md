title: "fate of a good student"
--- 


I believe a small portion of people have a good student attitude. But what even fewer is, an excellent attitude of a teacher.

But that's understandable. We're only humans, we have extent for all our patience, good manner. Sometimes emotion got in the middle, and might ruin a teaching process (or more).

I've had difficult teacher in my life. Sometimes they're temprament, impatient, or express their disappointment in harsh word. But don't take it on their word, take it on their knowledge. On what they can bring to the table, to _your_ table.

And I met several excellent teachers in live. I can sit and learn all they while them teaching. They're patient, they are actually passionate in what they're doing. I love them. I never forget each of their names, and I long for being teached with them in next opportunity.

One thing I always do, is I choose my teacher. Or at least, I'm selective on what to absorbs. Because, you know, we are what we're surrounded by. Even greatest plant in the world will be withered if placed in a jar full of poison.

Hence, I know, whatever suffering or difficulties I'll deal with in the time to come, I'll know that it's worth it. Because that's a student fate, they can only accepts whatever they teacher have, good or bad. That's the only way we - as students - can learn.

Not to mention it's difficult to find an actual good teacher, so better not waste your time once you find one. If you find good teachers, keep in contact with them. You might not find another them in your life, who knows when luck runs out ? ;)
