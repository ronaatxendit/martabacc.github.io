title: "straying away"
--- 

this pandemic has done us things we don't see before. one day it's a regular thing for me to have coffee(s) at one coffeeshop in the basement with my friends, but now the coffeeshop has closed due to WFH policy in the office.

but that's the thing that I'm not intended to - it's just a cause.

I can feel that I'm straying away for what I had in mind two years ago, with three-years old jeans wandering in the office. Spirited up for meetings, with bright eyes.

and now - I'm not anymore.

unmotivated, with not-so-ergonomic desk setup in my house. WFH everyday.

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful with what I have now. Lots of people losing jobs and may have no food for tomorrow.

but this is different - I'm losing me. I'm losing vision I had for myself and I feel like, this is not how it should go. I don't know what go wrong, and I don't know what to fix. Everything just about to tear apart, and I'm in the middle of the breaking parts. I'm about to fall.

what should I do to recover my vision? what should I do to self-encourage myself?
