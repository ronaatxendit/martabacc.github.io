KDrama is never my cup of tea, but some parts of it are. One of them was when Dal Mi replied by one of his friend, after she expresses his confusion and envy towards her, saying she deserve to be as success as she is.

"You can't. You lack discipline and focus."

Just simple tone, no anger in that sentence.

Not only Dal Mi got swept by that words, me too. That is literally me, things that I lack.

Everytime I want to quit, feeling tired, hesitant to take deeper steps - I always heard those sayings in my head. _we deserve what we deserve_. Gotta hustle hard then ends up as a failure.
