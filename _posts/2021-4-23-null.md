sometime destiny and our plan didn't go well. they cross, but not at the time we want them to.

and when it is not, I understands how it means to Nodejs, compiling _undefined_ value.

is it a bad state to be? No, not really
is it a _false_ ? No
is it a zero? No
is it a _null? No

the state when you are upset, but not sad. disappointed, and no anger.
