I often wake up tired these days.

Time had came for me to secure the chance of something I've dreamt for a long time. Been wondering for years to have a seat secured there, working with wonderful coworkers, thinking with the best minds.

But it was a pity, it didn't go as planned.

I didn't know whether I'm not good enough or they just savin' me for their _second option_. Regardless, ghosting is not a good practice, and it implies no good intention. Even company as big as Google inform their candidates two weeks, tops.

I was sad. Devastated. _Am I not good enough? If yes, where can I improve?_. That question left unanswered.

 Well, I can get there again anytime in next year, but disappointment's still in my head. Dancing in my mind, tirelessly - along with my other mistakes. They dances happily at the back of my head, day and night.

But again, life goes on. It doesn't end anywhere until it really ends. There's a lot of fine place to do marathons of life and career. Let's hope the destination we're going to is better than what we've failed to achieve.

It'll take lot of time to let that sink in, letting the idea evaporates. To tell ourselves that what is best for us might not be what we think it is. As long as we do our best, the good will follow.
