title: "hash brown"
--- 

I ate hash brown this morning. And I didn't order BTS meal since I despise chicken nugget. That's just flour mixed with chicken stock and no chicken meat at all.

So, I'm expecting a test at this evening. I was scheduled last Friday and actually I have five days to prepare.

I feel anxious. Last time I was in this was like three months ago, and my English was so slurred, I cannot focus at things I should have and ended up failing it. Today I feel jittery and I cannot focus at all. I didn't practice, I just reading and re-walking back my memories. Watching experience videos on youtube, hoping that will solve my slurry speech.

Actually doubted this time. Should I take this? But this will be a good chance anyway. At least it will be a good exercise and experience.
