title: "extreme disappointment"
--- 

never occurs to me that new year ever comes with such miserable pallete. I always tought it will be warm (as it was christmas), or blue - represents something calm.

apparently not this year. I cancelled my first property. Something's wrong in the process, and I've been thinking about it for a month. Thinking about cancelling it. The tradeoff was, I lose all my down payments. Silly me, it was in the order paper and I signed it without rechecking them first.

It costs me a lot. Sometimes when I went to shopping mall and saw things I wanted, dang, I could have bought that instead.

and also some other things I preferred not to tell here.

when something's wrong, it's very easy for us to look for a scapegoat. Something to blame. this has to be someone fault.

and don't ask me. I had a list of who is responsible and how they contribute in this costly mistake. Top of the list, it's me. but, no. I ruled it as an incident - no one fault. it just happened. there's so much lessons to learn from. 

that was what I said everytime this passes my mind. it was hard not to blame myself. this will always live rent-free in my head, taking space in the corner. this stupid mistake. if only I did this, if only I checked that, if only I _asked_.

if only.
