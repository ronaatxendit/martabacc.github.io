title: "mind palace"
--- 

sherlock holmes is one of the most exciting series I've ever watched. It really emphasize on presence of mind and elevate the slightest detail you must miss due to its trivial-ity.

one day I admire from Sherlock is how he leverage his mind power with anything - include substance abuse. I wonder how he haven't die after using like 6 nic patches on his arms, my soul would leave me 6 times with that kind of dosage I suppose.

but one thing that is really cool, and not really fictive (or maybe in the borderline) - is the mind palace. that particular technique is so powerful that you can remember something you put (virtually)  in there after years.

I watched it like 2 years ago, and I found it super exciting that I made my own mind palace. Mine is a big ass room, with white light, and windows at the left and right side of the room. Not really bright, the light - so that your eyes won't be tired after standing there looking for some records. My kinda book-paradise room.

And in that room, you will find empty racks, about ceiling-hight, not really high ceiling, standard ones. The racks is made of wood, solid ones, like the one of kayu jati. with dark brown color, and no texture. i can smell the wood aroma in my nose when i was there.

The racks is empty, of course - because I haven't filled them yet.

That time, I put two books in there, two people that matters in my life. I put them in first-left side of the rack, the first one after the door.

Now, after 2 years, I watch it again, and mind palace was mentioned in a scene. Struck like a lightning, it brings me back to my mind palace. it is wonderful how that room never change - the wind is still blowing and slips under the window. the wood aroma.

sherlock really discover how to leverage your mind. what a perfect mindset - despite how abusive he can be (to anything including himself).
