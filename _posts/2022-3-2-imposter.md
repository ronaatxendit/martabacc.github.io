title: "blessing in disguise"

Despite college year is one of the most flourishing year I had in my life, it's also the phase I felt outrage most often.

To be honest, I didn't like computer science in my first year. I didn't even think about it, I skipped classes and didn't give second thought about it.

If it's not for external factors, I won't make my way to what I'm doing now. And for the record, I'm forever grateful for the journey I've been through.

He-eh, I skipped a part. Why the hell did I feel outrage, you asked?

It's because I took college in East Java. There, the culture of patriarchy is so strong that I felt offended of the privilege it give to men and what not to give for women.

Once, I have to be dismissed from the lab because it's _curfew_. I remember I ride home feeling upset, sad, anger at the same time.

The reason of why I was dismissed is not because _what I'm doing_, it's because _what people think if I stayed there_.

If women stays overnight there, it's something shameful despite what she's doing is just learning and may take some sleep after midnight. And men can do whatever he want to do there even it's not learning-related. They just gaming all night, snacking all the time and what-not, what a waste to taxpayer money (it's government-subsidized institute). And it's not one-twice occasion, they did it everyday. They should do an audit of where's the facility goes, if they want to check on how much patriarchy spend compared to how much the return is.

Dang, that sounds resentful. No, I'm not hating patriarchy. What I resent is how unfair the position it put of women compared to men. I just didn't understand the mindset.

Both have brain, eats rice everyday, but why one can't enjoy the facility as much as the other? Why does one sent home and one can continue their work/game in a very privileged place with fast-speed wifi network, PCs free to use, an entire server to experiment with? Some men abuse the power patriarchy give them, and they close their eyes of what they're actually doing.

Well, one can argue that women can continue their learning at the next day. If you say that too, then you don't see my point. If this is an eating contest of 24 hour, one you only give 2 hour while the other have 8 to finish their plate. Who will win?

You guess, I didn't stay there after I graduated. I moved to capital because I know the culture here won't be the same. And it is.

One of the good thing I left from this bad culture is, afterwards I never let someone tell me what I can't do. It's never about their opinion, it's about what I can do. The grit sticks on me. I might not have much intelligence, but what I have in me is passion of never let something unfinished. It's either finished, or I didn't take it at all.

Thank you for the lesson, patriarchy. Oh, I mean, people who abuse the term and use them to say what women can't do and put limit to what they think best. For your information, your opinion is not asked but will be put as an appendix.
