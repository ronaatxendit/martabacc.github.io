title: "being bigger than our mistakes"
--- 

I had a gifted friend once in college. He was extraordinarily excels all fields in computer science. He was a straight A student. Well no wonder, he started the journey way back into junior high school, he was a candidate for international competitive coding and winning. He's the best graduate at our year, and he didn't even attend the graduation since he has a flight to catch to Singapore after, as he already secure position as software engineer for 50K salary there.

I envy him, though. He was privileged and he used them perfectly.

But, everytime I look at him, I compare to me. I was anger at myself for not excels as much as he do. I justify my current condition as punishment since I was not trying hard enough as he did.

That anger reflects to others. I get angry to myself for anything else - anything I find flawed. Especially when I involved in one, or given I had chance to change it.

I realized I have anger issues at the end of last year. Long story short, I dealt with it by taking time-out, and taking some steps back. That episode is really alarming, that I decide I cannot be like that anymore. I decide to forgive. I decide that  mistakes indeed happen, and there's nothing we can do except forgive and makes sure that don't happen again.

Fast forward a year later, I find myself a very different person. I become a lot more forgiving to myself. I become free. I can use the freedom of anger to do anything else, to learn, to watch series, to read, to eat, or anything.

I know what's the actual ground. I am afraid that I'm not enough, that I don't deserve what I have, despite how hard I try.

I make peace with it. It's simply admitting, that yourself is enough. That being not perfect, is okay. Human simply makes mistakes.

It was hard, you know. To dodge the temptation to blame yourself. To not let yourself putting you as the black goat for everything that happen.

That decision is, awakening. I realize how have anger has close one eye and this whole time I only see with one eye. It's awakening to see with both eyes - to see without being angry.

I can learn, I make decisions with clear eyes. I decide without being paranoid of being blamed of my future self for mistakes I might make.

It's liberating.

At some point, I'm afraid of another big mistakes in my life. Like, what could it be? How much low will it drag me? But now I know, at that time, I'll forgive myself, because I know myself will have done the best effort she can. She will thrive to the end, and if she misses anything, it won't happen twice.

She'll do good. :)
