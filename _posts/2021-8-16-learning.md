title: "learn to teach"
--- 

it's been like 6 years of my engineering career (and still counting~)

the path itself is a never-stop-learning process. I learn something new everyday.

But there's something I haven't learn before. It's about team-skills.

You know, engineering is about code and all. But there's something beyond that, it's about working as a team.

I want my team to grow with me. I want them to learn, I want them to excel as much as the team do. I want them to be better after they exit my team, under my guidance. Since I learn from them as well, it seems like a good trade.

Sometime it's about fixing their mistakes. Some about warning them before it happens. And sometime, it's about giving a firm reminder so they don't repeat the same mistakes again.

Well, I once in their position. I got warned with firm message(s) to from my senior (hahaha). It discourage me at first, but after some chill talks within the team after, I realize that they're not discouraging me. They're after my mistakes, making sure it won't happen again.

That's also what I'm doing now. At least paying the deed back to the community.

I hope they're not taking it personally. I just want them to be better engineer after they work together with me ;P isn't it cool to be a cool senior in the house~~~ hahahaha

Eh, eh, I also got couple things to announce. But maybe after this month lah ya, still not fixed yet :p
