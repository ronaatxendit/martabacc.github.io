Been a month since switched from long-term investment into short-period trader.

To be honest, it is an extreme sport. Walks you through wheel of emotions. One time brings you to despair, and another time bursts you with joy and triumph when they go up.

Such game of adrenaline (psst it's fun actually).

One time it go down, and I forgot to cut loss - I had to pivot. Average down, cutloss. For Mother's sake of Alabama I hate the latter.

One time it go up, and being greedy hoping it will go higher, and it didn't. Instead it dropped. I regret why I didn't sell it sooner.

At the end - it's just shares. It's just electronic shares.

What have I learned from this sport?
- perceptive & decisive - given opportunities and risks in front of you, what will you do?
- statistics & mass psychology (especially stockmarket ones)
- reading charts and indicators (obviously)
- read news. like A LOT. A HELL LOT OF IT.
- awareness to what's happening around, and forward thinking.
- risk management & adaptability. Loss is not the end of the world.
- not be so damn greedy. stick to the fucking plan.

I plan to allocate more into this bag, as its gain is bigger than terms deposit (I can make gain 10% monthly, meanwhile deposito just 7% ann.). At least aiming 100mio as capital to trading, looking around 1-2years for this aim :p see you on the other side!
