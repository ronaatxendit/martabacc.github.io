### An engineer who lives in Jakarta for another year.

Never thougt I'll ended up being engineery and all its stuff, but I really love what I do now. It suits me so much so it never comes to me that I'm actually working the entire day.

I currently having light interest in chess, and huge amount in software engineering updates. Also a tiny miny amount of interest in crypto mining.

I'd like to describe myself, in general, as *lack of natural ability but tries hard.*
